Overview.
=========
OpenGL 3D 'Star Wars'-style scroller featuring real True-Type fonts in a real 3D environment. Features GetGlyphOutline API, MIDI soundtrack, how to use the OpenGL glCallLists feature plus lots more.

When I created an earlier project Convert Fonts to Vector Graphics using GetGlyphOutline (CodeId=50004) to extract True-Type Font information, it was always my intention to use this data in a 3D environment. This project is the result.


Requirements.
=============
This project requires that OpenGL be installed on your system. It is probably already installed, but just in case it isn't visit the following website:

* OpenGL Getting Started FAQ
  http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/getting_started.html


I have included a "type library" file for OpenGL. This file is called "vbogl.tlb". You may already have this file on your computer, and it may already be registered in the system registry. You should not have to do anything with this file, but if you wish to register/unregister this type library visit my website for help:

* Register and Unregister type libraries

Feedback
========
If you've got any questions, praise or comments then send me an e-mail. If I don't respond straight away, it's because I'm having technical problems with my mail server (damm Microsoft!)
